# SwipeableSplitView
Trying to enable edge swiping on the native SplitView control in UWP.

1. This SplitView project was initially created based on Koen's awesome UWP templates. (https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b3eb9b90-cc39-4b5c-bf94-497cba6e4f6f)
2. Don't use IsPaneOpen, use IsSwipeablePaneOpen instead.
3. At the moment the swipe only works when DisplayMode is Overlay.
4. The code is not fully tested, let me know if you find any bugs.
